While patients increasingly have access to their clinical reports, they typically lack the medical training required to comprehend and contextualize the information present in their diagnostic reports. In this project, I either worked in a team or independently to answer the following research questions- what are the information needs of cancer patients from their radiology reports? What specific kinds of information do patients look for while browsing and comparing their diagnostic history? What challenges do they face during those activities and what visual and interaction techniques can we design to aid those activities? I worked with Dr. Matthew Hong, Clayton Feustel, Max Silverman, Dr. Stephen Simoneaux and Dr. Lauren Wilcox on these projects.
