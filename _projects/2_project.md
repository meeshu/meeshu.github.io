While a number of tablet visualization systems exist in the research community, very few visualization/BI systems exist in production and accessible to users. One possible reason for this is the complexity of the features in BI systems and how supporting the same functionalities on a tablet system requires introducing unfamiliar interaction mechanisms to the user.  If parts of the interface are not easily discoverable to users, it affects the learnability and usability of the system which could affect adoption.

In this project, I assisted Dr. Ramik Sadana and Dr. John Stasko in evaluating the discoverability of a tablet visualization system- Tangere and compared it to a commercially available tablet viz system- Tableauâ€™s Vizable.
