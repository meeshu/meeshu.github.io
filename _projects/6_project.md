|Summary|Duration & Location|Role|
|As a Product Designer at Apervita, I worked on a series of design projects related to clinical measure development capabilities of the clinical analytics platform. I redesigned existing workflows or designed new features to support new workflows to improve the measure building and testing experience of developers.|Aug 2018 - Feb 2019<br><br>Apervita|Product Designer on Apervita’s clinical quality measurement building capabilities|

### Identifying developer needs and design requirements
I used a combination of user (in house analyst) interviews, subject matter expert interviews and competitor analysis in order to understand the different users, their individual and team goals, workflows, technology usage and challenges with the technologies. Next, I would discuss these challenges and improvements with my UX Manager and Product Manager to identify which of them could be incorporated as part of existing user stories and which would we want to address as part of the next few sprints.

### Designing User Flows

The design team used a Kanban approach to manage the individual designer’s work pipeline. If the product team was designing new workflows or were significantly redesigning existing workflows for improved developer experience, I designed low fidelity mockups/ screen flows for all identified use cases or scenarios. These were then validated with engineering lead, QA lead and products to ensure that the flows were comprehensive in their coverage. These were also used by me to design any new component templates, by QA & tech lead to estimate efforts and by the product manager to adjust timelines.

### Designing Component States and Interactions

During the previous stage if a new component/s or significantly redesigned components were identified, I used Sketch and Invision studio to design different states of the component and transition between the different states. These were validated with the front-end engineer and QA engineer for tech feasibility and comprehensiveness (for e.g. are error states accounted for etc.)

### Designing High Fidelity Mocks

Once the flows and component designs were validated, I created high fidelity mockups. If there were no new components, I typically moved from validating user flows to this step right away. These mocks were then handed off to developers and qa in a grooming session.
