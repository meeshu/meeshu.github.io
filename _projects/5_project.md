### Identifying user needs and design requirements

In the first 3 weeks, I gathered existing user research data and interviewed stakeholders to identify target users and their mobile habits with regards to airlines apps. Another UX Designer (S) and I also carried out a competitive analysis to identify common information architecture and interaction design patterns used in the travel and hospitality industry. I also led 3 workshops consisting of tech, product and QA leads to finalize the navigation, home page design and style guidelines. In addition, I was responsible for establishing a UX design process for members of the design team, a UX collaboration process for working with product, development and QA teams and a UX sprint plan to track ux goals and deadlines.

### Designing User Flows

In each sprint, I defined user flows for 1-2 features by interviewing business analysts. We identified existing user flows on other digital channels such as the airline’s website and kiosk and adopted that workflow to a mobile app experience.

### Designing High Fidelity Mocks

Once the user flows were verified for functional coverage, a visual designer (K or W) updated the design component library with any missing components on a shared Adobe XD library. S and I then created high fidelity mocks of each flow and shared them with developers over a grooming session. This process was repeated for every sprint.

### Project learnings and challenges
Challenge #1: Our team worked with a really aggressive timeline with 2 weeks long UX Sprints that included both a feature research phase and design phase. From this experience, I learned how to plan UX sprints and efforts better. 

Challenge #2:Merging the user-centered design process within an Agile / SCRUM based development approach

Challenge #3: Design a fully native mobile experience to book flights which was unusual in the airline industry at the inception of the project. Further, we had an unbundled fare model which added additional steps to the booking process.
